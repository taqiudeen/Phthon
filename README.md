# Python

Welcome to my portfolio! My journey into programming began when I earned my associate degree at Milwaukee Area Technical College, where I learned the fundamentals of computer programming. This foundational knowledge has allowed me to apply my skills across several programming languages.

In this section, you’ll find my Python code, developed in Jupyter Notebooks. Here, I showcase the steps I’ve taken to achieve proficiency in Python, demonstrating my growth and understanding of key concepts.

Feel free to explore the projects and code snippets that reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for data analysis and technology!
